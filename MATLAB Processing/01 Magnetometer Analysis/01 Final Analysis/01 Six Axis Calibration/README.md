## Six Axis Calibration

This method executes only a hard-iron calibration, which accounts for > 90% of the errors in pitch, roll, and yaw.

## Procedure

1. Place the datalogger inside the plane.
2. Position the aircraft in 6 different positions covering +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, -z.
3. Hold each position for 3 seconds.

## Results

This method is slightly inconvenient but improves leads to the following outcomes:
	- Yaw: -+ 5° error magin.
	- Improved roll and pitch measurements, although not strictly dependent to the magnetometer.
