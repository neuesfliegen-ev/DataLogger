## Ideal Spherical Calibration

This method executes hard-iron and soft-iron corrections, and it is the most precise among all. However, capturing the data necessary to calibrate this is extremely complex for our purpose.

The calibration process should be done with the datalogger inside the plane, and rotating the aircraft in all possible positions reaching an almost full 3D spherical collection of data. It's is not feasible.
