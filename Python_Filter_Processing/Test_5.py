-This test is to show the effects of using a centered moving average filter with dynamic window size adjustment<
-This is the same concept as Test_4.py; as such I also recommend this
-Window size is 100 but can be adjusted to however big is needed. 
-The bigger the window size, the greater the smoothing
-Can be improved upon to accept real-time data points
