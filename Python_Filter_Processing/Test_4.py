"""
-This test is to show the effects of using the rolling mean function from pandas; it has built in edge handling.
-Window size is 5 but can be adjusted to however big is needed. 
-The bigger the window size, the greater the smoothing

I personally recommend this since there is no artifacting happening at the edges due to the window size
being dynamically adjusted at the edges.
